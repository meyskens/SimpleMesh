SimpleMesh
==========
SimpleMesh is a simple way to build mash networks using and Arduino and RFM69 chips. It uses ECDH to secure the network. SimpleMesh is as the name suggests very simple. It doesn't keep a map of the network thus repeats all messages it receives and is not suggested for big networks or high amounts of traffic.

## Background
SimpleMesh is developed for an international collaboration between TH KÃ¶ln and Thomas More Geel. Since we have never seen a solution like this we've decided to open source our work under the GPL License following the libraries we use.
